"""
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. 
For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

    """
    To solve this problem in O(log(n)) time we have to use techniques reminiscent of binary search to halve the 
    array in half in each step and retain only one half. 
    We will decide which half to retain by understanding the problem a little better.
    If a completely sorted array is rotated an n amount of times, now our array has 2 sorted parts,
    divided by a pivot, which is the smallest value in the array.
    When doing binary search, we will take the value in the middle as a posible smallest value and 
    by checking wheter or not it is smaller or higher thatn the left and rightmost values,
    we can know which half to keep looking at and which half to discard.
